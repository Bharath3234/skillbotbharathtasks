In the VLSI domain, the term "fast.lib" refers to a C++ library for FaST related functionality.
The timing library (.lib) is an ASCII representation of the Timing, Power and Area associated with the standard cells. 
It is used to characterize cells under different PVT conditions and is used for timing-based synthesis.
Designers use "fast. lib" cells as building blocks to create various parts of a digital circuit, such as arithmetic units, memory controllers, and control logic. By utilizing these pre-characterized cells, designers can reduce the time and effort required for circuit design andÂ optimization.
A "fast.lib" file typically includes information about:
1. Cell Delay: The delay introduced by each standard cell in the library.
2. Input/Output Capacitance: The capacitance at the inputs and outputs of the cells.
3. Power Characteristics: Information about power consumption for different activities.
4. Setup and Hold Times: The minimum time required for inputs to be stable before and after a clock edge.
This information is used by VLSI design tools for synthesis, place-and-route, and timing analysis to optimize circuit performance, power consumption, and area utilization.
fast. lib contains the number of cells, Area of the cell, Voltage, Current, leakage_power, capacitive_load, etc.
The "gpdk045wc" library refers to the Global Foundries 45nm technology process kit. It's a semiconductor process technology that provides a set of design rules, device models, and other data necessary for designing integrated circuits using the 45nm process. 
It will operate in the 1v,1ma and the time duration of 1ns and having leakage power_unit of 1nW and cell_leakage_power of 1.09891/cellrise.
The design incorporates a 7x7 matrix to specify delays for prescribed rise and fall times.
A and B are the input 
CI,CO are of outputs sum and carry.
The function for CO = ((AB)+(B CI)+((CI A)).
The above function performs carry operation.
pin S is used for sum function ((A^B)^CI).
delay templates are given as like index1 and index2.
It performs separate operation for each function using basic gates (CLKAND, CLKXOR, CLKOR, CLKBUF, CLKINV, CLKMX).
